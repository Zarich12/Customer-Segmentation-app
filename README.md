### Introduction
In marketing, market segmentation is the process of dividing a broad consumer or business market, normally consisting of existing and potential customers, into subgroups of consumers based on some type of shared
characteristics.


### Objective of the project
This project requires you to develop a customer segmentation to give recommendations like saving plans, loans, wealth management, etc. on target customers groups.


### Tech Stack used;
- Python
-Streamlit
-Jupyter notebook

### Algorithms used;
- K-means clustering
- Spectral Clustering
- Gaussian Mixture Model based clustering
- DBSCAN Clustering
- Agglomerative Clustering

### Processes
- Business understanding
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Model Building
- Model Deployment

### Deployment
We have created a Streamlit Application based on this clustering technique, where we are taking the customer details & identifying which cluster the customer belongs to;
